--schoolid: vandy = schoolname: Vanderbilt University


-- **ANSWER**
SELECT  
DISTINCT(p.playerid)
	  ,p.namefirst

FROM people AS p
INNER JOIN collegeplaying AS c
USING(playerid)
INNER JOIN salaries AS s
ON p.playerid = s.playerid

WHERE schoolid = 'vandy'

ORDER BY total_salary DESC;
-- Player id: priceda01 , First name: David , Last name: Price , Total salary: $81,851,296.00


--Double checking
